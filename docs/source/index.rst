Welcome to MEEG 42503 - Introduction to Robotics
===================================

About this Course
--------


This course serves as an introduction to robotics, covering the development of the field and the importance of integrating sensors, actuators, and end-effectors in mechatronic systems. Through lectures, mathematical modeling, computer programming exercises, and a term project, students will develop a fundamental knowledge base for the kinematic and dynamic modeling of industrial robot manipulators. Topics include the mathematical foundations for modeling robots, rigid body motions and homogeneous transformations, forward and inverse kinematics, velocity kinematics, and robot dynamics. While the course reviews some aspects of linear algebra and programming, it does not extensively cover these areas; therefore, familiarity with linear algebra and proficiency in a programming language are required for the assignments and term project.
